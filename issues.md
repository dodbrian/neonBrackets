# Issues

- color picker in settings should be more compact. Same as everywhere in other settings
  - current implementation with ColorPicker has very strange behavior that requests screen sharing
  - look for the example implementation in Rainbow CSV plugin
- do not colorize grayed-out redundant brackets
- do not colorize within chars: ''
